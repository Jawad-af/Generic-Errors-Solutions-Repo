| Error Solution |
 ----------------

The connected email was not connected with the remote repository.

we check it by excuting the command:

in: git config --global user.email

the output was: =


I tried to replace the connected emails firstly by running the command 

git config --global --replace-all user.email "the_email"

** this also did not work


THE FINAL SOLUTION WAS:

git config --global --add user.email "the_email"

after excution the command: 
git config --global user.email

the output was: the_email
