AUTHENTICATION FAILED
Cannot push or clone a github repo using the username and the password of the account.

 ----------------
| Error Solution |
 ----------------

**First make sure to create a classical token inside the github repo.**

Go to your account 
-> from the drop down menu go to settings 
-> on the bottom down on the left side bar you will find Developer settings or something 
-> choose Classical Token 
-> select all the options and add the token.


**Edit the git global configuration if needed**

check if the global configuration are set to you username and email

git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

if you cannot see anything OR you want to change the username or the email type in the command line 

git config --global --edit 

this will open a text editor that contains the global configuration file (.gitconfig)
edit them - save chagnes - exit

**Add the token instead of the password**

when you try to clone or push to the repo, github will ask you for the username and the password..
Add the token we generate previously instead of the passowrd of the account.
And it should work with no problems.


#Two types of errors I faced

1. The repository cannot be found
That happens in case you are not logged in with your personal credentials e.g. the global configurations are set to different username and email

2. The Authentication error 
Which we solved in this doc earlier.
